                It is so eminient that <b>technology is the order of the day and top-notch news in the world</b>. This is true because all field of studies have incorporated one form of software application to increase productivity and efficiency in their industry. I could trace my love for technology right from my secondary school days when i ensured i had a detailed note in computer studies subject so that i can practice with my dads desktop when i return from school that day. I wanted to pursue a career in the medical field but for some reasons, a sudden change into the computing science came up. I'm super excited i graduated as a Computer Scientist. As a result of my flare for the tech world, i always exploring different learning platforms, programs to in order to acquire more skills in the technology world. <i>The enormous benefits of vast skills and stress-free life achieved from the Technology world cannot be overemphasized.</i>

            <h1 class="name">The journey of stutern thus far</h1>
            <p>
                <i>It has been a wondeful learning experience from stutern so far.</i> I have had the opportunities of meeting with like minds in the tech industry and had several interactive sections with my peers during first two-weeks of study organized by stutern. Some of which i have learnt so far are; <b>Git & Github</b>, <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS.</b> <br>
                During the <b>GIT and GITHUB</b> we learnt how to create a repository on github, commit, create a new branch and how to push to this repository. I learnt how to clone someone else project and contribute to the development of their project.<br>
                Secondly, we moved on to <b>HTML</b> and i learnt how to use different HTML tags and elements to markup web pages.<i>HTML project</i> was another interesting section to strenghten the application of the lesson.<br>
                Presently, we are learning <b>CSS</b> which is helping me to see how i can style the marked up webpages and make it look more appealing. <br>
                <b>'CSS'</b> means Cascading Style Sheets which helps us to control how we want the web page to look like. CSS controls the fonts, texts, colours, backgrounds, margins and layout. CSS is important because it saves money, it helps you to redesign your site more quickly and modify your site designs to look how you want them to look.

                The CSS box model consists of; margins, borders, padding.<br>
                <b>Padding:</b> Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.<br>
